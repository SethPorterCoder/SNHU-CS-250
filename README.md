### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I personally like to map out bullet points that are the specific important details of the requirements of the client's requested product.  Once I have the points mapped out, I'll then create a backlog of what needs to be made and present it to the client to make sure it fits their vision.  The user stories really helped with creating this plan of attack because they allowed me to go through the same process in a controlled environment in the SNHU Travel Project.



### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach every application I create as I do when taking client requests.  I will sit down and map out the key points the application needs to achieve.  The key points will evolve as the development continues, so incorporating agile can definitely help out with the plan by allowing it to be adaptable.  Things will change, that's for sure, so it's important to be open to change.



### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think the criteria for a good team member is different from person to person.  In my opinion, I think a good team member is someone who's always willing to learn while also contributing to the project by effectively completing each assigned task in the project's backlog.  Allowing yourself to learn as you go while getting you're assignments done really sets you apart from the regular 9 - 5 programmer to someone who's truly passionate.
